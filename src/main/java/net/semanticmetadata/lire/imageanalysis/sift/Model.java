/**
 * Abstract class for arbitrary geometric transformation models to be applied
 * to points in n-dimensional space.
 * <p/>
 * Provides methods for generic optimization and model extraction algorithms.
 * Currently, RANSAC and Monte-Carlo minimization implemented.  Needs revision...
 * <p/>
 * TODO A model is planned to be a generic transformation pipeline to be
 * applied to images, volumes or arbitrary sets of n-dimensional points.  E.g.
 * lens transformation of camera images, pose and location of mosaic tiles,
 * non-rigid bending of confocal stacks etc.
