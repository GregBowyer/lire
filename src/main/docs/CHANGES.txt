CHANGES for LIRE
================
2013-06-25
==========
  - Mavenization of the project (Sandeep Gupta twitter.com/sangupta)
  - Removed all warnings of resource leaks (Sandeep Gupta twitter.com/sangupta)
  - Implemented type-safety by using generics than raw types. (Sandeep Gupta twitter.com/sangupta) - only partial patch

2013-06-23
==========
  - Added net.semanticmetadata.lire.indexing.LireCustomCodec to allow for faster linear search
    It still has to be activated by the user in the IndexWriterConfig.

2013-06-23
==========
  - Added a new distance routine to OpponentHistogram, that could prove faster when reading from an index.
  - Profiled search and found that the compressed stored fields made search awfully slow. Decompression
    takes up to 60% search time.
  - If an ImageSearcher starts with caching the byte[] values in memory, search time goes down rapidly.
    Results from a test:
      # of images in an index of OpponentHistogram = 50000
      init time of cached search: ms = 1414
      100 searches with the cached searcher: ms = 4186
      100 searches with the non-cached version: ms = 106879

==========
General:
  - Added image retrieval feature color correlogram
		- Use DocumentBuilderFactory.getAutoColorCorrelationDocumentBuilder()
		  to create documents with this feature
		- Use ImageSearcherFactory.createCorrelogramImageSearcher(int)
		  to search the index for them.
		- Note that this feature is quite slow and pictures are resized to 
		  200x200 for analysis (originals won't be touched, just in RAM)!
