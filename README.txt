              LIRE - Lucene Image REtrieval
      (A Homage to Lots of Great Holidays in Italy)
==========================================================

The LIRE library allows the creation of a Lucene Index for
content based image retrieval (CBIR). Furthermore  methods
for searching the index are provided.

This library is part of the Caliph & Emir project and aims
to provide the CBIR features to other Java projects  in an
easy and light weight way.

For more information on the usage of LIRE see the online
docs:
